Pure RL Agents: I implemented Q-Learning agents that learn through Self-Play. They play against each other to get smarter without human help!  Symmetry Optimization: To make them "genius" faster, I added logic so they understand that a board mirrored left-to-right is the same situation. This cuts the learning time in half!
